Adapting Estimators
===================

.. tip::

    This chapter describes interfaces required for writing a :mod:`pandas`-aware estimator from scratch, or for adapting an estimator to be ``pandas``-aware. As all of :mod:`sklearn` is wrapped by Ibex, this can be skipped if you're not planning on doing either.
